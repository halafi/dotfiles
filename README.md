# dotfiles

I use VSCODE + VIM plugin as I got [tired of maintaining Neovim](https://filiphalas.com/from-neovim-back-to-vscode) running properly and since I could never really got rid of doing certain things in VSCode such as debugging, jupyter notebooks, etc.

My dotfiles for karabiner (60% keyboard layout), tmux, fish and everything configurable.
Setup for web development (React with TypeScript), Go, Lua and Rust on macOS Monterey.

Managed with [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

## Terminal

I am mostly using VSCode terminal these days with Tmux + Fish and [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2) for macOS.

- [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) üêü with [ohmyfish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (no session management at the moment)

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) to give some GUI to git commands

- [goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo/) + [karabiner elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) for making 60% keyboard layout usable

- [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to manage language versions

<!-- - [Finicky](https://github.com/johnste/finicky) as default browser proxy to separate work from personal browsing -->
