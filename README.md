# dotfiles

Update: currently migrating to VSCODE + VIM plugin as I got tired of maintaining Neovim running properly.
Also since I could never really got rid of doing certain things in VSCode such as debugging, jupyter notebooks, etc.

At the moment removed LSP config as I prefer to have Neovim as stable text editor rather than IDE.

My dotfiles for Neovim, tmux, fish and everything configurable.
Setup for web development (React with TypeScript), Go, Lua and Rust on macOS Monterey (LSP config no longer maintained).
Managed with [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

## Terminal

I am using [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2) for macOS.

- [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) üêü with [ohmyfish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (no session management at the moment)

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) to give some GUI to git commands

- [goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo/) + [karabiner elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) for making 60% keyboard layout usable

- [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to manage language versions

- [Finicky](https://github.com/johnste/finicky) as default browser proxy to separate work from personal browsing
